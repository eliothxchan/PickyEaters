# PickyEaters

The back-end of the Picky Eaters mobile application.

At Picky Eaters, we've encountered the following scenario day in and day out.

Friend 1: Where do you guys want to eat?
Friend 2: How about X?
Friend 3: Nah, how about Y?
Friend 4: No but Z has a deal going on today.
Friend 1: I'm not really feeling Z though, what else?
Friend X: Ad nauseum.

We wanted to create a system that helps users decide where to eat, and fast. Picky Eaters pulls nearby restaurants using Yelp, and each user is allocated a number of vetos such that when all are used up, only one restaurant will remain.

Veto quickly! Once the session begins, anyone is allowed to veto whatever they want, as long as they have vetos remaining. What will be the last restaurant standing? Only you guys will know. And hopefully, you'll know quickly.
